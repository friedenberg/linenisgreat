<p>Hi, my name is Sasha And I used to be an engineer at Etsy</p>
<p>This is an adaptation of a blogpost I wrote three years ago</p>
<p>Focuses on a transformation of app releases</p>
<p>But before we continue, understand how Etsy ships web</p>
</aside>
<aside class="notes">
<p>And when I talk about shipping web I’m really focusing on the social
engineering aspects I’m not going to talk about how Etsy takes new code
and deploys it to servers There’s a bunch of great blog posts by my
colleagues explaining that process I can point you to later Right, so
how does Etsy ship web?</p>

<section id="via-a-push-queue" class="slide level1">
<h1>Via a Push Queue</h1>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Etsy uses something called a push queue.</p>
<p>It’s best to just walk through an example to get a feel of how this
works.</p>
</aside>
<pre>
<code>
Topic of the #push channel
</code>
</pre>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Imagine we’re in Slack</p>
<p>Highlighted is the topic of the push channel Currently it’s empty</p>
<p>Fun fact: Although Etsy deployments actually started off in IRC Ask
me later about how channel topic length limit differences between Slack
and IRC broke deployments</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>My colleague Hannah (nick: mittens) has joined the queue She’s
indicating to everyone she has code she wants to deploy Because the
queue was empty before she joined She becomes the driver Pushbot lets
Hannah know she can push her changes Now I join the queue Because I have
code I need to deploy too Notice me typing dot-join in Slack modified
the topic That’s pushbot doing that Both hannah and I push our changes
We let others know we’re ready by marking .good Pushbot let’s us know
we’re ready to deploy to staging with both our changes Hannah deploys to
preprod She uses a tool called Deployinator It’s basically a button for
a bunch of shell scripts While that staging deploy is happening Nassim
joins the queue We have a more interesting topic now so let’s understand
what these things mean This is the whole push queue These are the push
trains it consists of And these are the drivers of their respective
trains There can be up to 8 people in one train Anyone can take over
driving a train Trains can also be specified as special by designating
them as a hold, which prevents others from joining There’s a bunch of
commands to manipulate the queue, all via Slack If problems arise, you
can manually change the topic as a last resort Ok, looks like our
staging deploy is finished so Hannah and I check our changes Look at
graphs / logs Confirm staging tests passed Manually test our changes and
some key pages (like search, cart, listing page) Great, our changes are
good If they hadn’t been good we’d redeploy a hotfix to staging or
revert that person’s changes and they’d leave the queue</p>
<p>So now we deploy to production Hannah hits the button</p>
<p>The deploy is complete, so we test our changes</p>
<p>Our changes look good on prod too, so we end our train Pushbot hands
off to the next train If the changes had issues A Make a hotfix Push
Deploy to staging, then to prod B Push a revert Deploy revert to staging
and then to prod Ask me later about what happens if deploys fail, Or if
the site goes down</p>

<h1>Web Deploys</h1>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Are pretty fast (~20 min)</li>
<li class="fragment">Happen many times a day (up to 50)</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Ok, so we just went through a deploy These happen very often, up to
50 times a day And it’s a goal of a dedicated team to keep deploy time
down. Aim for less than 20 minutes from start to finish During a deploy,
all the members of the active push train are Responsible for monitoring
And the driver is accountable for getting the deploy To production</p>
<p>This approach highlights some tenets of Etsy Engineering:</p>

<p>Ok, so that’s web deploys. What about app deploys?</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>They’re very different They take longer to propagate for one Etsy
doesn’t control the Apple App Store or its app review process Because
they’re slower to propagate They happen less often They’re limited by
the slowest part of the process (Apple App Store Review) Although that
has gotten much better And because they happen less often, They’re
larger And because they’re larger They’re more error prone And because
they’re more error prone, they need more testing</p>
<p>It might be helpful to compare web deploys and app releases as flow
charts</p>

<section id="app-deploys-1" class="slide level1">
<h1>App Deploys</h1>
<p><img data-src="img/stainless%20project%20review_1.png" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Yeah This is a lot more complicated, because we have External factors
like the app store and google play Internal factors like manual testing
before releases</p>
<p>The difference between a web deploy and app release is kinda like the
difference between a modern flight to California and an
pre-revolutionary ship to the north american continent Flights across
country are ordinary, frequent, and very dynamic If you miss a flight,
there’s one in a few hours Plus, they don’t take very long Whereas,
Ships across the Atlantic are less ordinary, less frequent, and require
a lot of planning and testing They also include quite a bit of risk If
you miss a ship, the next one isn’t for several months</p>

<h1>App Deploy Tasks &amp; Responsibilities</h1>
<p><img data-src="img/stainless%20project%20review_2.png" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>This more complicated nature of App releases Means there’s work
related to moving through that flowchart you just saw</p>
<p>Things like manually branching in git Hitting a button in itunes
connect Sending emails about who is in what release and when it’s going
out</p>
<p>So app releases are slower, riskier productions than web deploys. And
Remember in web deploys?</p>

<p>Release Managers, Sasha &amp; Jen</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>We have two release managers One for the buyer apps on Android and
iOS (me) And another for the seller apps on Android and iOS (Jen)
Responsible for moving release through all the phases Communicating
Troubleshooting and conflict resolution Button-pushing (my favorite)</p>
<p>Ok, so Etsy is chugging along with two release managers for about a
year It’s alright. We’re shipping every two weeks for each app
Leapfrogging But there are issues People have poor visibility into the
state and deadlines for a release Engineers get frustrated about having
to deal with a release manager for bugfixes And the release managers are
getting overwhelmed with the amount of button pushing they have to
do</p>
<p>And then Jen leaves Etsy, and we’re left with one release manager</p>

bring parts of that over to the apps?</p>

<p>We built a vessel that coordinates the status, schedule,
communications, and deploy tools for app releases Here’s how Ship helps:
Keeps track of who committed changes to a release Sends Slack messages
and emails to the right people about the relevant events Manages the
state and schedule of all releases It’s a single source of truth for all
app releases</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine all of that abstractly, so let’s do an app
release together:</p>

<p>Russ makes his first commit to the iOS app for v4.64.0. Russ commits

<p>Everyone installs the testing build and indicates their status</p>
<p>A cron branches the release and creates a release candidate.</p>
<p>Great, now we hit branching time, and a cron generates a release
candidate This candidate is sent out to a testing team, which performs a
bunch of manual testing</p>
<p>final testing finds no show-stopping issues</p>
<p>A cron submits v4.64.0 to iTunes Connect for review.</p>
<p>Ship sends an email letting folks know the release is approved.</p>
<p>A cron releases v4.64.0.</p>
<p>Ship sends an email letting folks know the release is out on
prod.</p>
<p>Ship emails a report of top crashes to all the subscribers of the
release</p>
<p>I actually don’t have any screenshots for the remaining phases, so
we’ll just have to imagine together ;-) The testing team finds no
issues, and they hit a “tests pass” button A cron submits the build for
review Ship sends a status update email when the build is approved Or
when it’s rejected The release date arrives, And if the build was
approved, Ship releases it IT sends another email at release time
notifying people And then one 24 hours later with a list of top
crashes</p>
<p>Before Ship, all of this would’ve been performed manually But you’ll
notice that release managers are missing from the above process have we
replaced release managers with all the automations in Ship?</p>

<p>Nope! We added release drivers Analogous to the push train driver,
they take on the following: Corraling folks around checkpoints like
testing and release Determining escalation paths Pushing buttons Really,
like one button</p>
<p>Drivers are selected from folks that have previously committed to the
apps Prioritizing those that have driven less frequently Ask me about
how that became a problem later</p>

<p>The end result of Ship is that we’ve distributed release management.
Etsy no longer has any dedicated release managers. But it does have an
engineer who used to be one Hi</p>
<p>People cannot be fully automated away. That applies to web deploys,
and is equally true for app releases. Our new process works within that
reality. It’s unique because it pushes the limit of what we thought
could be automated. Yet, at the same time, it empowers our app engineers
more than ever before. Engineers control when a release goes to prod.
Engineers decide if we’re ready to branch. Engineers hit the buttons.
And that’s what Ship is really about. It empowers our engineers to
deliver the best apps for our users. Ship puts engineers at the
helm.</p>
